## Finding Components

### Search

Press `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open search. Type a component name like "button", "hero", or "pricing" to find what you need.

### Browse by Category

Components are organized into two main groups:

**Marketing Blocks** — Landing page sections like heroes, features, testimonials, pricing, footers, and calls to action.

**UI Components** — Interface elements like buttons, inputs, cards, modals, tables, forms, and more.

Open the sidebar or command menu to browse all categories.

### Browse by Author

Click any author name to see all their published components. Follow your favorite creators to discover new work.

Each card shows:
- Live preview thumbnail

Click a card to open the **preview dialog** for a quick look, or click through to the full **component page**.
