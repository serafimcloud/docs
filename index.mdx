## Canvas: visual frontend work on your repo

21st is a **visual frontend canvas for your real repository**. Canvas turns your repository into a visual workspace where each frame is a branch. You work on real code with live previews, use **Iterate mode** for direct edits, and **Plan mode** when you want multiple implementation approaches to compare side by side — all before you open a PR.

**Your core loop:**

- Describe what you want in chat — from small tweaks to new flows
- Let AI propose edits or multiple variants, grounded in your repo and context
- Review diffs and previews on the canvas, then iterate again or open a PR

## Community: components for Canvas and AI agents

On top of Canvas, 21st includes a **Community** library of open-source React/Tailwind components, real app screens, and themes that you can use inside Canvas or with any AI coding assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, Lovable, etc.).

- Copy components and drop them into your repo via Canvas or your editor
- Use component links and prompts directly in Canvas chat as building blocks
- Paste prompts into AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, Lovable, or others to generate variations in their environments

## Who is 21st for?

- **Frontend engineers** — Build and refactor UI faster on a live repo with an AI coding agent.
- **Designers** — Turn ideas, references, and screenshots into high-fidelity React components.
- **Product teams & founders** — Prototype, compare variants, and collect feedback on real running UIs.

## What makes 21st different?

- **Frames as branches** — Every Canvas frame maps to a Git branch or empty project variant.
- **Works on your real codebase** — Run your app inside 21st, not just mockups.
- **Community of real components** — Not just screenshots: installable, remixable React code.
- **AI that understands context** — Combines your repo, components library, and inspiration screens.
