description: Visually work on your frontend. Get AI-powered product solutions.
---

21st is a visual frontend development tool. Work on your repository in a canvas where each frame is a branch, see changes visually, and get AI-powered product solutions for your features.

## Two Ways to Work

**Visual Frontend Work** — Work on your repository in a canvas where each frame is a branch. See your changes visually, iterate quickly, and compare approaches side by side.

**AI Product Solutions** — Use Plan mode to explore multiple implementation approaches. The AI researches components from 21st.dev and your favorite apps, studies your codebase, asks clarifying questions, then creates several plans with different variations. When you approve, each plan becomes a working branch you can compare and refine.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Repository** — Link your GitHub repository. 21st scans your components, design system, and patterns to understand your codebase.

2. **Choose Your Mode** — Use Iterate mode for direct code editing, or Plan mode to explore multiple implementation approaches with AI research.

3. **Work Visually** — See your changes in real-time, compare multiple approaches side by side, and iterate quickly in the canvas.

4. **Get Your Code** — Create a PR for connected repos, or download/copy code for blank frames. 21st never commits directly — you control when changes are integrated.
