title: Plan Mode
description: Get multiple implementation approaches with AI research
---

Plan mode helps you explore different ways to implement a feature. The AI researches how other products solve similar problems, studies your codebase to understand your constraints, asks clarifying questions, then proposes several implementation approaches — each with reasoning about why it works.

When you approve a plan, it becomes a working branch you can see, test, and refine. Compare multiple approaches side by side and merge the best parts.

## How Plan Mode Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research">
    Before asking questions, the AI automatically researches:
    - Components from the 21st.dev library
    - Your favorite apps from the [community screens](https://21st.dev/community/screens) section
    Bookmark apps at https://21st.dev/community/screens so the AI understands which apps inspire you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Study Your Project">
    The AI analyzes your codebase to understand your patterns, components, and architecture.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Clarifying Questions">
    The AI asks questions to better understand your requirements and preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Multiple Plans">
    The AI generates several implementation plans, each with a different approach or variation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Approve">
    Review the plans and select which ones you want to implement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Branches">
    For each approved plan, the AI creates a new branch (frame) in your canvas, each implementing a different variation of the feature.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Favorite Apps

To help the AI understand your design preferences:

1. Browse screens at [21st.dev/community/screens](https://21st.dev/community/screens)
2. Bookmark apps that inspire you or match your style
3. The AI will reference these when researching solutions in Plan mode

<Tip>
The more apps you bookmark, the better the AI understands your taste and can suggest solutions that match your preferences.

## Example Workflow

Imagine you need to add a user profile page. Here's how Plan mode helps:

1. **You request**: "Add a user profile page"
2. **AI researches**: It looks at components from 21st.dev, studies your bookmarked apps (maybe Linear's clean profiles, Stripe's detailed views, Vercel's minimal approach), and analyzes how similar products handle user profiles.
3. **AI asks**: "Should it include an activity feed? What information is most important to your users?"
4. **AI creates 3 plans**:
   - Plan A: Minimal profile with key stats (inspired by Vercel's approach)
   - Plan B: Full profile with activity timeline (similar to Linear)
   - Plan C: Card-based layout with tabs (more traditional, easier to scan)
5. **You approve Plans A and C** — you want to compare minimal vs. detailed
6. **AI creates 2 branches** — each with working code implementing a different approach
7. **You compare visually** in the canvas, see which feels right, and merge the best parts

You get working code for each approach, so you can make an informed decision by comparing real implementations.

<Tip>
After Plan mode creates branches, you can use Iterate mode to refine each implementation or merge ideas from different branches.
