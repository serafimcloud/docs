title: Iterate Mode
description: Full-featured coding agent with standard tools
---

Iterate mode is a full-featured coding agent powered by frontier models — the same code quality as Cursor and Claude Code. It directly edits your project with access to standard coding tools like grep, terminal, file operations, and code generation.

## How Iterate Mode Works

Iterate mode works like a standard AI coding assistant. You describe what you need, and it edits the code directly in your current variant (frame).

### Standard Coding Tools

Iterate mode has access to all the tools you'd expect from a modern coding agent:

- **Code generation** — Write new code, components, and features
- **File operations** — Create, edit, delete, and move files
- **Grep/search** — Search through your codebase to understand context
- **Terminal** — Run commands, install packages, execute scripts
- **Code analysis** — Understand existing code patterns and structure

### Powered by Frontier Models

Iterate mode uses the latest frontier AI models — the same level of code quality and understanding as Cursor and Claude Code. It writes production-ready code that fits your patterns and style.

## When to Use Iterate Mode

  <Card title="Quick Fixes" icon="wrench">
    Fix bugs, update styles, or make small changes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refactoring" icon="code">
    Improve code structure, extract components, or optimize
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Updates" icon="plus">
    Add functionality to existing features

## Example Workflow

1. **You request**: "Fix the button spacing in the header component"
2. **AI analyzes**: Uses grep to find the header component, understands the current styling
3. **AI edits**: Updates the spacing directly in the code
4. **You see the change**: The variant updates with the fix applied

Or:

1. **You request**: "Add error handling to the API call in the user profile"
2. **AI searches**: Finds the API call, understands the context
3. **AI writes**: Adds try/catch blocks and error states
4. **Done**: Error handling is now in place

<Tip>
Iterate mode is perfect for tasks you'd normally do in Cursor or Claude Code. For exploring multiple approaches, use [Plan mode](/canvas/plan-mode) instead.

## Working with Variants

Each variant (frame) can have multiple chats in Iterate mode, with separate
contexts per conversation. For details on how chats relate to variants and how
to manage multiple chats, see
[Chat Modes & Commands](/canvas/ai-chat).

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Be specific** — The more context you provide, the better the results. Reference specific files, components, or patterns.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use @Codebase** — Mention files from your repository using `@Codebase` to give the AI better context about your codebase structure.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Iterate incrementally** — Make small, focused changes rather than large refactors. It's easier to review and understand.
