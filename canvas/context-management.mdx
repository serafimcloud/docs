## Chat Context

Context helps AI understand your style, structure, and intent. The better the context, the better the generation.

### What you can add as context

- **On‑canvas items**: any shape already on the canvas (variants, components, inspiration screens, images)
- **Images via upload**: screenshots or assets you attach in chat
- **@Codebase**: files from your connected GitHub repository

### Three ways to add context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Shift+Click (on canvas)">
    Hold Shift and click any shape to add/remove it from context. Selected context is highlighted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hover → Add as reference">
    Hover a non-active canvas item and click the floating "Add as reference" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inline mentions with @">
    In the chat, type `@` to open the inline menu. Start typing to search by name — the AI instantly searches through file names, frame names, variants, and references as you type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips

<Tip>
**Explore & Merge**: Explore multiple variants, then add another variant as context to merge the best parts into one result.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Assemble sections**: Build sections/pages separately, then multi-select them and ask AI to assemble everything into a single cohesive component or layout.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Be explicit**: When adding context, state exactly what to apply and from which reference (e.g., "Typography from Button A, spacing from Card B").
