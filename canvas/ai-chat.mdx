description: How chat works with variants, inline commands, and generation modes

## Chat ↔ Variant

Each variant (frame) can have multiple chats. Click the **+** button in the chat header to create a new chat for the same variant. View and switch between all chats for a variant in the chat history panel (similar to Cursor).

### Multiple Chats per Variant

You can create multiple chats for a single variant (branch):

- **Create new chat** — Click the **+** button in the chat header to start a new conversation
- **View chat history** — Access all chats for the current variant in the chat history panel
- **Switch between chats** — Jump between different conversations to work on different aspects of the same feature
- **Isolated contexts** — Each chat maintains its own context and conversation history

This is useful when you want to:
- Work on different parts of the same feature in separate conversations
- Keep discussions about different approaches organized
- Maintain separate contexts for different tasks

### What is a Variant?

A variant is a frame on your canvas. What it represents depends on your setup:

- **Connected repository**: A variant is a branch in your real project with a live preview of your actual codebase
- **Blank frames**: A variant is an empty project for iterating on ideas and exploring concepts

Each variant can have multiple chats, and duplicating (forking) a variant keeps all chat histories in the copy.

## Inline Commands (`@`)

Type `@` in the chat to reference:

- **@Codebase** — files from your connected GitHub repository
- **@Variants** — components/variants (frames) on your canvas
- **@References** — reference items you've added to context

Start typing to search by name — the AI will instantly search through file names, frame names, variants, and references as you type.

<Tip>
Images: attach via the upload button to use as context.

## Modes

### Iterate (default)

A full-featured coding agent powered by frontier models — the same level of code quality as Cursor and Claude Code. It has access to standard coding tools like grep, terminal, file operations, and code generation.

- **Direct code editing** — Edits the currently selected variant/frame in place
- **Standard coding tools** — Uses grep, terminal, file operations, and more
- **Frontier models** — Powered by the latest AI models for high-quality code generation
- **One focused result** — Produces a single, focused implementation

### Plan

Creates multiple implementation approaches for a feature. The AI researches components and apps, asks clarifying questions, then generates several plans. When you approve, each plan becomes a separate branch.

- Researches components from 21st.dev and your favorite apps
- Studies your codebase
- Asks clarifying questions
- Creates multiple implementation plans
- Generates separate branches for each approved plan

<Tip>
Use Plan mode when you want to explore different approaches. Use Iterate mode for direct edits and quick changes.
