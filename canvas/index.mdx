description: Visual frontend work where each frame is a branch
---

Canvas is 21st's visual frontend development tool. Work on your repository in a canvas where **each frame represents a branch**. See multiple approaches side by side, iterate visually, and work with AI that understands your codebase, components, and design system.

## What are Variants?

Each frame on your canvas is a **variant** — but what that means depends on how you're working:

### Working with a Connected Repository

If you've connected your GitHub repository, each variant is a **local branch** with a live preview. You're iterating on your actual codebase, seeing real changes. Branches stay local until you open a PR — only the selected branch gets published to GitHub when you create a pull request.

Since 21st runs your real application, you can **share preview links** with colleagues and clients to get quick feedback on new features or prototypes — no deployment needed.

### Working with Blank Frames

If you're working with blank frames (empty projects), each variant is a **separate empty project** for iterating on ideas. Perfect for exploring concepts, prototyping features, or experimenting before integrating into your main codebase.

<Warning>
  21st doesn't commit directly to your code. You control when and how changes
  are integrated.

## Getting Your Code

21st doesn't commit directly to your repository. How you get your code depends
on whether you're working with a connected repo or empty frames. For a complete
guide and export options, see
[Getting Your Code](/canvas/getting-code).
