21st doesn’t commit directly to your repository. How you get your code depends
on your setup.

## Working with a Connected Repository

If you’re working with an existing project (connected GitHub repository):

- **Open a Pull Request** — Select the branch you want to publish, then create a
  PR. Only the selected branch will be pushed to GitHub.
- **Copy Git Patch** — Get a patch file you can apply to your local repository.

## Working with Empty Frames

If you’re working with empty frames (branches in an empty project):

- **Download All Code** — Download the complete project as a ZIP file.
- **Copy Code** — Copy individual files or components directly from the editor.

<Tip>
  For connected repos, use PRs for team collaboration. For empty frames,
  download or copy code to integrate into your project manually.
