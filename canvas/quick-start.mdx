description: Get started with Canvas in minutes

Get up and running with Canvas quickly. Choose your path and start building.

## Choose Your Setup

You can work with Canvas in two ways:

### Option 1: Connected Repository

Work on your existing project by connecting your GitHub repository. Each frame becomes a branch in your real codebase with a live preview. Share preview links with colleagues and clients to get quick feedback.

**Best for**: Working on your actual product, team collaboration, creating PRs, getting stakeholder feedback

### Option 2: Blank Frames

Start with empty projects to explore ideas and prototype features before integrating into your main codebase.

**Best for**: Exploring concepts, prototyping, experimenting with new features

## Quick Start Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Repository (Optional)">
    If working with an existing project: - Go to **Team Settings →
    Integrations** - Enable GitHub and select your repository - Wait for
    indexing to complete See the [GitHub Integration
    guide](/canvas/github-integration) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your First Variant">
    - Click **New Variant** or press `N` to create a new frame - If connected:
    this creates a branch in your repository - If blank: this creates an empty
    project to work in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Mode">
    Select how you want to work: - **Iterate mode** (default): Direct code
    editing for quick fixes and changes - **Plan mode**: Get multiple
    implementation approaches with AI research
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Building">
    Describe what you need in the chat: - "Add a user profile page" - "Fix the
    button spacing in the header" - "Create a dashboard with analytics cards"
    The AI will help you build it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Your Code">
    When ready to integrate: - **Connected repo**: Create a PR or copy a Git
    patch - **Blank frames**: Download the project or copy code files
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Which Mode Should I Use?

- You know what you want to build
- Making quick fixes or updates
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding features to existing components

- Need to compare UX patterns
- Want AI to research how others solve similar problems
- Creating multiple variations to test

## Essential Tips

<Tip>
  **Use @Codebase** — When working with a connected repo, mention files using
  `@Codebase` to give the AI better context about your codebase structure.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Bookmark Favorite Apps** — For Plan mode, bookmark apps at
  [21st.dev/community/screens](https://21st.dev/community/screens) so the AI
  understands your design preferences.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Multiple Chats per Variant** — Create multiple chats for the same variant
  using the **+** button in the chat header. Switch between chats to work on
  different aspects of the same feature. View all chats in the chat history
  panel.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Share Previews** — Since 21st runs your real application, you can share
  preview links for any branch with colleagues and clients. Get feedback on new
  features or prototypes instantly — no deployment needed.
